[#Project 1](https://github.com/Anna-Gaplanyan/Data-Mining-and-Predictive-Analytics-/tree/main/Group%20project)

The usage of data mining in education, especially in the online learning aspect, has become a necessity. The
database gained from the elearning environment(Moodle system) needs to be processed, and we need data
mining tools in order to get insights into the data. Our project aims to represent the whole phases of processing
the e-learning dataset and putting into use data mining techniques such as visualization, clustering, and
classification for the Moodle log records. These techniques will help predict studentsâ€™ academic performance,
group students based on their similar features that will be formed by processing the data. The results of our
project can be used by universities that use Moodle learning management system to create a new education
system that will inform students that they are at risk of failing. Secondly, universities may predict the
low-performing students and sign learning contracts with them. That contract allows students to attend more
office hours, prioritize homework and reading, and show more improvement in exam performance. "These
learning contracts are low-cost, low-effort tools to increase student commitment, boost academic performance,
and encourage self-direction.

Criminality is a major danger to humanity. It is growing and spreading at a rapid and broad scale. The
police face significant challenges in crime prediction and criminal detection. Hence, the goal of the project is
to use various data mining tools and techniques in order to predict the crime rate and detect crime hotspots
based on locations. This project will aid police forces in forecasting and identifying crime in a given location
and diminish the crime rates.

Insufficient attention has given to rental price setting mechanism in rental market of Armenia on the [Airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com/) website. During this project all the listings of forty-six urban areas were scraped and the influence of different characteristics on the housing prices in forty-six urban
areas were studied. The project raises important questions about pricing in the sharing economy and generates
hedonic price model and different machine learning algorithms to predict the prices. Some
conclusions and recommendations are done based on the estimated results.
